Add an edge_device property to EdgeComponent and its modeling_objects_whose_attributes_depend_directly_on_me should be its edge_device. Remove edge_device from modeling_objects_whose_attributes_depend_directly_on_me in RecurrentEdgeDeviceNeed because it will be automatically included downhill. Add a check that ensures that RecurrentEdgeComponentNeeds can never point to an edge device that is not the same as the edge device of the RecurrentEdgeDeviceNeed they belong to.
Actually keep EdgeComputer and EdgeAppliance signatures the same as they were (except for the removal of power_usage_effectiveness and utilization_rate for EdgeComputer). For both, all fabrication footprint will go to structure. For EdgeComputer, power and idle_power will go to compute and ram won’t have power.
Beware that as of now, the "workload is between 0 and 1" check isn’t made anymore in RecurrentEdgeWorkload class when its recurrent workload parameter is updated.
