Better thanks. Now I have a problem in EdgeComputer and EdgeAppliance. Updating the builder parameter should trigger recomputation. Like for example, when updating EdgeComputerâ€™s power, the cpu power should be updated to trigger modeling recomputation. How can I implement this behavior in my code? I have the same problematic in RecurrentEdgeProcess.
