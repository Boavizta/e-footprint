## Who is e-footprint for ?

**e-footprint is a tool for teams who want to ecodesign the digital services they develop** (for example, a product team in a start up or big company). Even if it is a technical tool, it is not only for the most technical people in the team (architects, devs, data scientists). In fact, the environmental impact of the service is everyone’s responsibility, just as its commercial success is. Moreover, we’ve seen the [Why e-footprint ?](why_efootprint.md#how-precise-does-the-modeling-need-to-be) article that e-footprint also incorporates a user journey and usage language that will speak to tech professionals with a less technical background.

## Team organization
What we recommend is that an **e-footprint owner** be identified in the team, who will be responsible for the building and maintenance of the modeling by soliciting all team members for their input. If using the python package, this person must have basic python skills, but an interface is underway that will completely remove any need for a technical background to get started with e-footprint. **The e-footprint owner can thus be any person from the team, with or without technical background. The only prerequisite is a willingness to gain skill on the understanding and use of the tool.**

While there is one owner responsible for fully understanding the modeling of the digital service built by the team, when ecodesign decisions are made or when the impact of a new feature is anticipated, **the whole team looks at the simulation and makes a collegiate decision**.

The e-footprint model owner is very much advised to read and understand the [e-footprint methodology](methodology.md), [why e-footprint has been built](why_efootprint.md), and its [model choices](design_deep_dive.md).
