# The e-footprint methodology

## High-level modeling then refinement
**Ecodesigning with e-footprint is an iterative process.** Since e-footprint is a modeling tool, it is possible (and advised) to **start with a very high level modeling of the studied system**. This first modeling will be very inaccurate but give useful orders of magnitude: I know that the impact potential of my ecodesign initiative will be much greater if my first modeling shows me 1000 tons of CO2 / year than if it shows only 100 kg / year, and I will size my efforts accordingly. An advantage of this approach is that it doesnâ€™t require the installation of any tool. Then, depending on the results of this first analysis, I have 3 choices:

- **Stop modeling** because my system is too small to justify investing in ecodesigning it.
- **Invest effort to increase the granularity of my modeling** because it is not enough to guide decision.
- **Decide that the model is detailed enough** to make decisions and got to the next step.

## Modeling analysis
If the system is big enough, and once the model has been refined enough, comes the analysis time. It consists in **diving into the results of the model to understand where emissions come from and what the emission reduction opportunities are**. For example, if the analysis shows that much of the impact comes from the network, I can look up the network ecodesign best practices for inspiration, or simply ask the tech team. 

## Simulation and priorisation
When ecodesign opportunities or new features are considered, they are implemented as changes to the e-footprint model, e-footprint computes the new impact of the system, and the difference between the old and the new footprint is the **environmental return on investment of the action**. Since modeling often takes orders of magnitude less time than implementing, this approach allows for an efficient **prioritization of effort: you will finally be able to choose the most impactful best practice for your particular conditions** !
