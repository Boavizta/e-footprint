# Welcome to the e-footprint documentation !

The documentation is a work in progress but you can already explore e-footprintâ€™s objects and their relationships in the object pages that you can navigate on the left tab !

Here is the structure of an e-footprint object page:

# Object name

## Params
The parameters required for the creation of the Python object. Parameters can be attributes representing a physical or technical property of the object, or another e-footprint object.

## Backwards links
The list of objects that have the current object as attribute

## Calculated attributes
Calculations made by the e-footprint model. For each calculated attribute, its direct parents and related formula are given, as well as a link to its calculation graph representing its full origin.
