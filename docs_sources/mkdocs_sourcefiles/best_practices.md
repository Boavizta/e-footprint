Best practices shine best when the systems they apply to have little variability. We’ve seen in the [Why e-footprint ?](why_efootprint.md#how-precise-does-the-modeling-need-to-be) article that digital services are highly variable, so starting with a list of best practices to apply puts us at risk of spending efforts on actions that have very little leverage. This doesn’t mean that best practices are useless; rather, they should come in as a resource after a modeling has show where to act.
